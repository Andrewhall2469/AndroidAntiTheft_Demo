Final_Project_Code

My Anti-Theft App for my Final Project at University, this is a personal project but I am open to suggestions from anyone.

This is currently UNFINISHED but please contact me if you find any errors/bugs.

This Application is designed for Android Devices & Provides the following functionality:

In App:

Locate the device on a Map Over Wifi/Cellular

View the Camera & Take a Picture which pulls back to the application

View the details of the device the application is installed on

Lock The Device - UNFINISHED

Master Reset The Device 

External Web Resource(Remote Control):
http://andysantitheft.getforge.io/

Because Android requires Google accounts, this application and interface are linked through them.

So if control is required you would be prompted to log-in on the application with your Google Drive account. 

This would then mean when prompted on the external resource, you would need to log-in here with the same credentials.

Functionality on Remote Control:

Lock The Device

Master Reset The Device

Pull Location Co-Ordinates into a file on Google Drive - UNFINISHED

Pull Device Details into a file on Google Drive - UNFINISHED 

Take a Camera Picture an pull it into a file on Google Drive - UNFINISHED
