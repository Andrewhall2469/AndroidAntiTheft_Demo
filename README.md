Final_Project_Code

My Anti-Theft App for my Final Project at University, this is a personal project but I am open to suggestions from anyone.
This is currently UNFINISHED but please contact me if you find any errors/bugs.

This Application is designed for Android Devices & Provides the following functionality:

In App:
Locate the device on a Map Over Wifi/Cellular
View the Camera & Take a Picture which pulls back to the application
View the details of the device the application is installed on
Lock The Device - UNFINISHED
Master Reset The Device 

External Web Resource(Remote Control):
http://andysantitheft.getforge.io/

Because Android requires Google accounts, this application and interface are linked through them.
So if control is required you would be prompted to log-in on the application with your Google Drive account. This would then mean when prompted on the external resource, you would need to log-in here with the same credentials.

Functionality on Remote Control:
Lock The Device
Master Reset The Device
Pull Location Co-Ordinates into a file on Google Drive - UNFINISHED
Pull Device Details into a file on Google Drive - UNFINISHED 
Take a Camera Picture an pull it into a file on Google Drive - UNFINISHED
